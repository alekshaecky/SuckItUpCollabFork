* When asked to choose a (text/code) editor, choose an editor you are familiar with and that you have.
* When prompted, !! Make sure you Override the default branch name and call it main.
* When asked about line endings, use the default: Configure line ending conversions to make sure to commit with Unix-style endings.
* â€¦ for everything else, use the recommended/default settings.

1. When done, open Git Bash (from the Desktop shortcut that was created). This is a console window to use with Git.

## Pushing your changes to GitHub (More TBD)

1. Make sure your project builds and runs in Unity WTHOUT ANY ERRORS. If you upload Errors, everyone else will have to deal with them as well.

## Keep local backups

1. Use **Assets > Back Up Unity Project** via the included `DIYVCS.cs` editor script.

1. Make regular backups to an external drive or to the cloud. Something will go wrong, and you will need your backups.
